# MachineLearningA-Z_Udemy
 Homework assignments and practice for the Machine Learning A-Z course on Udemy
 
 To enhance my learning process, I have decided to rewrite the assignments into different classes as phase 1 of my project (using inheritance) and then automating the process as phase 2 of my project. Note that I'm not doing this to enhance the applicability of my code - I find that I learn best from pre-written code when I try to reshape it into a new structure.
